                <p>This book has top-notch dialogues. The author does not waste readers time on pointless info dump or mindless action. He will let the protagonist explore the world and acquire knowledge with engaging conservations or by other means. Although the novel has a second chance plot, the MC does not retain memories only feelings which means he does not go around collecting items and skills like other regressors. Instead, we get to see MC going on adventures in the fantasy world to change himself. He is a hopeless gambling addict which has ruined his life in the modern world. The characters have some of the best personalities I have seen in a long time and they behave in a realistic manner. Even the emotions are perfectly blended together with their conservations.The story atmosphere is really good, in dark moments it has a heavy psychological impact with eerie feelings while the light moments feels refreshing to read. If you love to read captivating conservation between characters with little to no action and is a fan of survival, adventure, fantasy theme novels with the added touch of romance then you should definitely give it a try.</p>

                <p>The novel is beautifully paced. To others, it feels like a grind and is slow, while others get overly emotional and passionate about the events that take place. The main character takes the road to his own choice. When a door closes, he leaps to a window. If that window is force ably shut, at this dead end, finds a chance and took it. The themes of life is one's own choice, death is unavoidable but not yet arrive. The small events and details leap to help with how the world is built. Contrasting the emotions or even the rational decisions of others, the main character leads the story in direction one would not think of.</p>
